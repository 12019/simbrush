Wrapper modules:

These perl script have the main purpose to translate the raw data in an intellegible form, siutable for the forensics practitioner.

1) wrapper_simple.pl
It translates all the standard data by creating an xml file that it can be seen in any web browser.
usage => "perl wrapper_simple.pl file_in.xml"
The output file will be "file_in.out.xml"


2) wrapper_dom.pl
it translates all the standard data and non standard data. For the latter only the header is translated, being unknown the
coding for nonstandard elementary files.
usage => "perl wrapper_dom.pl file_in.xml"
As output it will have "file_in.out.xml", representing the translation according with the DOM (Document Object Model) standard,
and "fat_file_in.txt", representing the "File Allocation Table" related with the SIM/USIM card.
